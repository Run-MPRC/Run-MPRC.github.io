I agree that as a member, or guest, of The Mid-Peninsula Running Club (hereinafter “the club”),
I know that running in and volunteering for organized group runs, social events, and races

I will not participate in any club organized events, group training runs or social events, unless I
am medically able and properly trained. I certify that I am medically able to perform all
activities associated with the club and am in good health, and I am properly trained.  I agree to
abide by all rules established by the club, including the right of any official to deny or suspend
my participation for any reason whatsoever. I assume all risks associated with being a member,
or guest, of the club and participating in all club activities, which may include but not limited
to: falls, physical contact with other participants/members, volunteers, race personnel, contract

I understand that bicycles, skateboards, baby joggers/strollers, roller skates or inline skates,

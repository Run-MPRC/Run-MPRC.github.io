  "Since 1988, the Mid-Peninsula Running Club has brought together runners from all walks of life on the San Francisco Peninsula (San Mateo County). Our club emphasizes forging connections while enjoying the outdoors. We have over 200 friendly club members who share a love for staying active and enjoying nature.",
  "Every Saturday morning at 8:45 a.m., we meet for introductions and start our one-hour out-and-back run/walk on the Bay Trail. Most of our participants cover 4-6 miles in the hour. We also have special events just for our members throughout the year, giving us more chances to have fun together.",
  "Come and join us- we're all about running, making friends, and having a good time. It's a great way to start the weekend! Our members come from all over the Bay Area! Members have come from San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Los Gatos, or Fremont just to run with us!",
  "Still, most of our members come from San Mateo and surrounding cities including but not limited to: Foster City, Burlingame, Belmont, Redwood Shores, Hillsborough, San Carlos, Millbrae, Redwood City, South San Francisco. Our club brunch occurs at one of these nearby cities, because we're usually too hungry to go farther.",

  "We believe in creating a running community where everyone feels encouraged and connected. That's why our motto is 'Support One Another!' We try to pair newcomers with a run or walk buddy because we want people to feel welcome, and like they're really part of a club.",
  "But it's not just about the miles - it's about the friendships, the shared laughs, and the great food! We have a large group of runners that loves to get brunch at different restaurants after our runs, to enjoy different foods and get to know each other.",
  "Join us in celebrating the joy of running and in our mission of supporting one another. Let's explore the trails, share some stories, and enjoy the run â€“ one step at a time!",

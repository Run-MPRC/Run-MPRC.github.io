          Every Saturday morning, we run along the scenic Bay trail near downtown San Mateo.
          With the motto "Support One Another", we try to partner new members with a similar paced runner!
          Many of our members enjoy the company and conversations on their runs, and paces vary widely.
          We welcome runners of all paces as well as walkers (and their dogs).
          Even non-members are welcome to run with us as well, but yearly membership is only $15/year per person and $20 for the whole family.
          We use the money to help us book venues, pay for food, and buy supplies for our seasonal picnics and events.
          For more details on how to run with us, check out our

        <Paragraph>
          Our informal motto is &ldquo;The eating club with a running problem&rdquo;.
          We love to eat just as much as we love to run (probably more)!
          After most Saturday runs, we organize a group to try a different restaurant that we vote on.
          If you're looking for a group of food-enthusiasts, this might be the place!

          Celebrate the end of each month with our Run Club Socials!
          On the last Saturday of each month, our club members bring food and drink to share.
          These gatherings are a way for us to connect with other members over
          homemade baked goods, fruits, snacks, and refreshing beverages!

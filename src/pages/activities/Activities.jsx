          Every Saturday morning, we run on the part of the Bay trail near
          downtown San Mateo. We welcome all paces and walkers as well.

          We love to eat just as much as we love to run (or more)!
          After most Saturday runs, we organize a group to try brunch at nearby places.&rdquo;

          Celebrate the end of each month with our Run Club Socials!
          On the last Saturday of each month, our club members bring food and drink to share.
          These gatherings are a fantastic way to connect with other members over
          homemade goodies, fruits, and refreshing beverages, provided by the club!
